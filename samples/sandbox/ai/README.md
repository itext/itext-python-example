The `table_of_contents.py` example requires additional Python packages, which
are listed in `requirements.txt`. Additionally, you need to have a local
Ollama instance running with a `Qwen2.5` model pre-pulled.

For further information on how to setup the environment or customize the LLM
environment used, check the comments in the `table_of_contents.py` script.
